## Why

Job searching in Switzerland is fragmented — the same listing appears on jobs.ch, LinkedIn, JobScout24, and several other platforms simultaneously. You end up manually deduplicating, copy-pasting cover letters, and losing track of what you applied to.

Swiss Job Hunter automates the boring parts:
- Scrapes 8 Swiss job boards and deduplicates across sources
- Scores each job against your CV (fast keyword match + LLM deep analysis)
- Generates tailored cover letters via Claude / DeepSeek
- Tracks every application with a Kanban board and event timeline
- Supports multiple job directions (e.g. Agent Engineer + Perception Engineer) with separate CVs

## Features

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| ⬇ | **Multi-source scraping** — 8 Swiss job boards, httpx + Playwright; search Switzerland-wide or by city |
| 🔁 | **Smart deduplication** — SHA-256 exact match + MiniLM semantic similarity |
| 📄 | **Full JD enrichment** — fetches complete descriptions beyond preview snippets |
| ⭐ | **CV matching** — two-stage scoring: dynamic keyword pre-filter (LLM-extracted from CV, cached) then full LLM deep analysis; irrelevant jobs are archived before consuming tokens |
| 🎯 | **Direction tagging** — auto-detected from `data/cv_*.txt` files; each direction uses its own CV and keyword cache |
| ⚡ | **Keyword presets** — one-click preset groups per direction (e.g. PERCEPTION loads `computer vision engineer`, `ADAS engineer`, `sensor fusion engineer`, etc.) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) and/or [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Donvink/swiss-job-hunter.git
cd swiss-job-hunter

pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

cd ui && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # Claude API (cover letters, LLM scoring, company lookup)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...        # DeepSeek — cheaper alternative for scoring
LLM_PROVIDER=auto              # auto = use whichever key is configured
```

### 3. Add your CV

Place one or more CV text files in `data/` using the naming convention `cv_{direction}.txt`.
Each file defines a search direction; the backend auto-detects them at startup.

```bash
# Single direction
cp your_cv.txt data/cv_agent.txt

# Multiple directions (different roles → different CVs)
cp your_agent_cv.txt      data/cv_agent.txt
cp your_perception_cv.txt data/cv_perception.txt
```

The `data/cv.txt` file is used as a fallback when no direction is specified.

### 4. Start

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
python server.py

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd ui && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**

## UI

The sidebar guides you through the full pipeline:

```
① SEARCH → ② PIPELINE (Enrich → Score → Company Lookup → Purge) → FILTER → LOG
```

**① SEARCH**

Pick a direction (ALL / AGENT / PERCEPTION / …), then choose keywords and sources.

- **Keyword presets** — click **⚡ PERCEPTION** or **⚡ AGENT** to instantly load a curated keyword group and switch to the matching direction:
  - **PERCEPTION**: `computer vision engineer`, `ADAS engineer`, `sensor fusion engineer`, `autonomous driving engineer`, `robotics engineer`, `perception engineer`, `SLAM engineer`, `robot perception engineer`, `motion planning engineer`, `autonomous systems engineer`, `robotics software engineer`
  - **AGENT**: `machine learning engineer`, `AI engineer`, `deep learning engineer`, `LLM Application Engineer`, `agentic AI`, `GenAI engineer`, `MLOps engineer`, `AI software engineer`, `applied scientist`
- **Batch keywords** — type a keyword and press **Enter** or **,** (comma) to add it as a tag; press **Backspace** to remove the last one. All keywords are searched in sequence across every selected source.
- **Location** — leave blank for all Switzerland, or type a city. **ALL CH** button clears it.
- **Pages** — number of pages to fetch per source per keyword.
- **Sources** — toggle individual boards or use **ALL**.

When **LinkedIn** is selected, two extra dropdowns appear:
- **Time range** — 24h / 7 days / 30 days
- **Experience level** — Entry–Senior / Associate–Senior (default) / Senior only / Senior–Director

**RUN SEARCH** scrapes only. **⚡ SEARCH + ENRICH + SCORE** runs the full pipeline in one click:
1. Search all keywords across selected sources (with automatic 5s LinkedIn cooldown between keywords)
2. Enrich descriptions for every source
3. LLM score all enriched jobs

The pipeline button is protected against double-clicks — a second click while running logs `✗ Pipeline already running` and is ignored.

**② PIPELINE**
- **ENRICH DESCRIPTIONS** — fetches full JDs for jobs that only have a preview snippet
- **ENRICH + LLM SCORE** — enriches then immediately scores with LLM in one step
- **SCORE (KEYWORD)** — fast keyword match against your CV, no API cost
- **SCORE (LLM)** — two-stage: keyword pre-filter first (skills extracted from your CV, cached to `data/cv_keywords_{direction}.json`); jobs below the threshold are archived without an LLM call, the rest get full deep analysis via Claude/DeepSeek
- **LOOKUP COMPANIES** — generates a short LLM summary for each company, cached
- **PREVIEW / PURGE** — dry-run or delete scored jobs below a score threshold

**FILTER** — filter by status (NEW / SHORTLISTED / VIEWED / CONSIDERING / APPLIED / …), minimum star rating (★–★★★★★), minimum match score (≥ N%), and free-text search

**LOG** — live SSE output from every pipeline operation; shows a pulsing **●** indicator while any operation is running, and per-source progress every 10 jobs fetched

**BOARD** — job list with score bars, status badges, direction tags, and star ratings; click a job to open its detail panel with tabs:
- **DETAIL** — full JD, match score, translate button; click **TAILOR CV FOR THIS JD** to run ATS analysis
- **COMPANY** — LLM-generated company summary (cached)
- **TIMELINE** — per-job event log with manual note entry
- **APPLY** — cover letter generation and email application
- **TAILOR** — missing keywords (chips) + per-bullet rewrite suggestions (original → improved + reason); **REGENERATE** reruns the analysis

**TRACKER** — Kanban board across all application stages

---

## Application Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| NEW | Just scraped, not yet reviewed |
| ANALYZED | Keyword-scored, awaiting LLM scoring |
| SHORTLISTED | Scored above threshold |
| VIEWED | JD opened in the UI |
| CONSIDERING | Read the JD, interested but not ready to apply |
| APPLIED | Application sent |
| INTERVIEWING | In interview process |
| OFFER | Offer received |
| REJECTED | Rejected |
| ARCHIVED | Filtered out (low score or manual) |

---

## Multi-Direction Search

Target multiple job types with separate CVs — directions are auto-detected from files in `data/`:

```bash
# Filename convention: data/cv_{direction}.txt
cp your_agent_cv.txt      data/cv_agent.txt
cp your_perception_cv.txt data/cv_perception.txt
```

Restart the backend and the new directions appear automatically in the UI dropdown. The system:
- Tags scraped jobs with the active direction
- Loads the matching CV automatically when scoring or generating cover letters
- Lets you filter the job list by direction
- Uses direction-specific keyword caches for the pre-filter

The **⚡ preset buttons** are mapped to directions by name — adding a `cv_perception.txt` file automatically makes the PERCEPTION preset available.

Add as many directions as you like. The `data/cv.txt` file is used as a fallback in ALL mode.

## CLI

```bash
# Scrape jobs
sjh search "AI Agent engineer" --location "Zürich" --source jobs.ch

# Enrich with full descriptions
sjh enrich --source jobs.ch

# Score against your CV
sjh analyze                    # keyword scoring (fast)
sjh analyze --llm              # LLM scoring (accurate)

# View top matches
sjh top --limit 20

# Generate cover letter
sjh cover <job_id> --lang en

# Daily summary
sjh digest
```

## Adding a New Job Board

1. Create `scrapers/my_board.py` extending `BaseScraper`
2. Implement `source_name` property and `scrape()` async generator
3. Register in `scrapers/__init__.py` → `SCRAPER_REGISTRY`

```python
class MyBoardScraper(BaseScraper):
    source_name = "myboard.ch"

    async def scrape(self, keyword, location, max_pages):
        # yield ScrapedJob instances
        ...
```

---

## WSL / Windows Notes

If running on WSL with a Windows browser, add to `~/.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then `wsl --shutdown` and restart.

---

## Responsible Scraping

- Random delays between requests (1.5–4s)
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Automatic 5s cooldown between keywords when LinkedIn is included
- Respects rate limits — do not set `SCRAPER_DELAY_MIN` below 1.0
